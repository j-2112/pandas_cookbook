# Pandas Cookbook
I will be following along with the various `ipynb` files that go with the book

I coppied all of them into the main folder, which means we can accesss the `data/` folder directly

## Requirements
The author installs anaconda, which has a lot of packages. I will be using pip install right now, which means
I'll need to install some of the packages.

- pip install jupyter (if using in venv, or we can just install this to the base interpreterter)
- pip install pandas (remember, this also installs numpy, so we dont need that)
- pip install openpyxl (optional)
